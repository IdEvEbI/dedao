# 我曾七次鄙视自己的灵魂（纪伯伦）

Seven times have I despised my soul(Kahlil Gibran):

The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.

当能进取时，选择了顺从现状，此为其一；

The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.

在瘸子面前跛行，此为其二；

The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.

当面临着困难和容易的选择，选择了后者，此为其三；

The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.

犯错后以其他人皆会犯错为借口，此为其四；

The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.

因软弱而忍耐，并把这种忍耐归于坚强而聊以慰藉，此为其五；

The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.

鄙视丑恶的面孔，却不知自己早已是那副面孔，此为其六；

And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.

唱起颂歌，还以美德自诩，此为其七。
